                  <h2>PU Footwear system – SANYOL® PU</h2>
                  <p>India is the 2nd largest producer of footwear in world with a CAGR (2022-27) of about 12.83%. Our
                     market research shows that many of the earlier manufacturers in footwear have transferred their
                     operations from a rubber base to PU. PU Soles have revolutionized how footwear is manufactured and
                     used. The Italian PU footwear machines were the first fully automatic machines which improved the
                     productivity and number of pairs per day for the user company. Followed by Chinese and Indian
                     machines the whole game got changed as the capex reduced and every footwear manufacturer tried to
                     get an in house PU Footwear manufacturing machine. </p>
                  <div class="more-cont" style="display:none;">
                     <p>The Polyurethane (PU) sole is the end result of injecting 3
                        major components for reaction
                        namely Polyol, Isoprepolymer & Cross Linker. The formulation involves adding of a catalyst or
                        additive to control the reaction and rising time of the sole in a mould. A typical PU footwear
                        machine involves a head having 2 streams of Polyol + Cross-linker and Isoprepolymer to fill in
                        the
                        mould as per required density and hardness of sole which passes through a heated chamber to
                        complete the reaction. Chappals mould are such that the finished product is produced directly as
                        PU
                        has binding properties as well. Shoe soles are generally being produced separately and are then
                        pasted in the upper part of a shoe. A PU sole is the most advanced technology in footwear having
                        amazing properties of being flexible and rigid at the same time.</p>
                     <p>A set of Polyol & Isoprepolymer is termed as PU Footwear
                        system. Polyols are formed by a high
                        temperature based polymeric reaction which has a high molecular weight. Polyols can be typically
                        classified as Polyester based or Polyether based. Isoprepolymers are a result of reaction
                        between
                        MDI/TDI (Methylene/Toluene Diphenyl Isocynate) and Polyols to form a stable compound. In India,
                        pure MDI/TDI production has been banned as it comes under hazardous category. Though various
                        companies are doing blending of the product.</p>
                     <p>San Polychem in its market research has found out that most of the PU raw material suppliers are
                        a
                        multi-million dollar Multinational corporations involved in production or trading of PU Footwear
                        system. Whereas, very few Indian companies are merely surviving the battle against this high
                        capital intensive business. As told earlier that India is second largest in producing footwear
                        yet
                        the PU Footwear raw material availability is completely dependent on foreign countries, we
                        decided
                        to put our efforts in making this product readily & extensively available in market without any
                        lags or delays of importing the raw material from other countries by promoting Make in India
                        scheme
                        of Government of India.</p>
                     <p>By working along with Industry’s best minds, we started production operations in 2019 and since
                        then we are catering to multiple clients in India. Our products are high in quality and have
                        desired specifications as per the sole quality required. We have various different ranges for
                        products used in Chappal making, Sole making and Safety shoes making & can be custom made
                        according
                        to the specific requirement from client. We also deal in specialized requirement in Footpads raw
                        material, soft sole material, high hardness material etc.</p>

                  <h2>Industrial Water Treatment Chemicals – SANYOL® WT</h2>
                  <p>According to a recent report of Government & Independent organisations, about 22% of fresh water is
                     being used by Industries. In India, comparing per person availability of water in 2001 at 1816
                     Litres to 1367 Litres in 2031 is being projected which is a matter of concern. With rising
                     population and rising demand of industries the situation might get further deteriorated for
                     availability of water. We need to act and need to act fast. Our target should be to maximize
                     recyclability and reusability of this 22% of Water as it will also reduce the fresh water
                     contaminations caused due to mixing of Industrial streams and Fresh Water stream. </p>

                        flexible packaging industry where we
                        cater the clients with raw materials for flexible packaging. Flexible packaging is widely used in
                        food items due to its many advantages like light weight, easy to fill, long lasting printing,
                        sealing etc. Flexible packaging is superior to any other packaging like plastics, metal, paper or
                        glass in the present times. It is either a solvent based or solvent free solution based on the
                        application. It is based on a two component system which works on the principal of Polyol &
                        Isoprepolymer being coated together to form a Polyurethane layer which gives good adhesion
                        properties for strong bonding of multiple layers in a roll.</p>
